Which of the G10 currencies is the riskiest to hold for a Swiss resident?
====

Our project is about finding which will be the riskiest currencies, in term of an Riskmeassure, for a Swiss citizen who has CHF and has the G10 curencies (expect Switzerland) to choose.
The Riskmeassures we will use are Expected Shortfall and Variance




DATA SOURCE: API Layer, Currency Data API



How to do it:
---
Compute the variance and Expected shortfall of the G10 curency to the swiss curency. 

Now compare them and show if there is some difference with the two risk measures. 

The results will be shown in a Latex presentation and a Document.

How to get the data
---
First Download the whole folder from Github

run the Get_ES_and_Variance by conda

Create all tables give all the tables used in the Document

and for the interactive app run g_10_interactive_app
